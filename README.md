# John Beresford's Lab - 2023 Edition

This repository contains a collection of my web and graphics experiments. Each
`experiment` is a self-contained React application that is ultimately built out
using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). That build is then used and hosted in the
`lab` [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app.

You can find the source for the experiments in the `/experiments` directory.

The live website is available at https://lab.john-beresford.com
